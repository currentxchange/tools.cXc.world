# Introduction

These tools integrates with our [media NFT standards](https://standards.cXc.world) for Atomic Assets.

> These standards keep spacetime data, which we call web 4. 

# Live Tools 🛠

## Media Category/Schema Creator 

⚡️ Live on [tools.cXc.world](https://tools.cXc.world)

We make it easier to get started with a well structured NFT collection. 

Load + customize fields based on our [media NFT standards](https://standards.cXc.world)

- Create web4-compatible media categories (also called schemas) using a simple UI.
- Select from predefined standards and modify them for your needs.
- Works with AtomicAssets and Atomichub out of the box.

> Tip: Uncheck the fields you don't want to use that may clutter your collection. For example, if you're using the `date` field to store the date, you can uncleck the `month`, `year`, and `day` fields.

## UPS 🌎🔺 Localized curation contract for Antelope blockchains

⚡️ Find it on [tools.cXc.world](https://tools.cXc.world)

**What it does 🤘🚀** 

The Ups contract creates a Reddit-like upvoting experience on WAX blockchain.

**Tokenized Curation** 

Use Ups to run your own web3 reddit, with communities based around NFT collections or any web domain.

*What is a subreddit here?*

To continue the Reddit analogy, the Ups contract uses domains like a subreddit, except a domain can only be a domain name (like youtube.com) or a colleciton name (like cxcmusicnfts).

*What is a post*

A 'post' on Reddit is like content on Ups. Content can either be a specific URL on a domain, like youtube.com/?v=yourvidzz14, or a template in a collection, like 655780 in collection cxcmusicnfts.
