# Introduction

These tools integrates with our [media NFT standards](https://standards.cXc.world) for Atomic Assets.

> These are web4 standards, meaning they keep spacetime data. 

# Live Tools 🛠

## Web4 Category/Schema Creator (pending release on [tools.cXc.world](https://tools.cXc.world/nft/schema))
We make it easier to get started with a well structured NFT collection. 

Load + customize fields based on our [media NFT standards](https://standards.cXc.world)

- Create web4-compatible media categories (also called schemas) using a simple UI.
- Select from predefined standards and modify them for your needs.
- Works with AtomicAssets and Atomichub out of the box.

> Tip: Uncheck the fields you don't want to use that may clutter your collection. For example, if you're using the `date` field to store the date, you can uncleck the `month`, `year`, and `day` fields.
